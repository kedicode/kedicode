I am a passionate follower of Christ, a husband to my wonderful wife, a father to two amazing boys (almost men), and a lover of various technologies. I became a self-taught developer way back in 2012, before it was the cool thing to do. I am driven by a desire to continually improve and better myself. See below for some interesting things about me, and follow my GitHub for some good ole coding fun.
